STEPS TO CONFIGURE ANONYMOUS COMMITS IN GIT
============================================

1. Navigate to your project directory
   cd /path/to/your/project

2. Set anonymous username (local to the repository)
   git config --local user.name "anonymous"

3. Set anonymous email (local to the repository)
   git config --local user.email "anonymous@localhost"

4. Verify the configuration
   git config --local --list | grep -E "(user.name|user.email)"

   Expected output:
   user.name=anonymous
   user.email=anonymous@localhost


IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

- Local only: Using --local means this only affects the specific repository, 
  not your global Git settings

- Email choice: Use anonymous@localhost or any email NOT associated with a 
  GitHub account. Avoid using GitHub's noreply emails as they're linked to 
  your account

- Existing commits: This only affects new commits. Previous commits will 
  retain their original author information

- Per repository: You need to run these commands in each repository where 
  you want anonymous commits
